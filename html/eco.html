      <h1>We are Eco-Conscious!</h1>
      <p class="mt-4 eco">
        Here at No 67 hairdressers we not only love your hair but our planet
        too. We pride ourselves in trying to be as environmentally friendly as
        we can and over the past few years we have removed nearly all our single
        use plastics and disposable waste, turning to reusable and washable
        alternatives.
      </p>
      <p class="eco">
        We’ve joined forces with a great company,
        <a href="https://papernotfoil.co.uk/">paper not foil</a>, who have
        invented a reusable and biodegradable alternative to foil.
      </p>

      <p class="eco">
        Where possible we try to use sustainable products,
        <a href="https://www.paul-mitchell.co.uk/">Paul Mitchell</a> in
        particular are particularly good on this, which is why we stock and use
        within the salon and wide range of their product.
      </p>
      <p class="eco">
        We also use Vegan colours by
        <a href="https://www.montibello.co.uk">Montibello</a> called Denuee.
        Denuee is the first and only water, ammonia-free 90% natural permanent
        hair dye that delivers the colour and shine of natural hair. There
        manifesto is one that we also believe in, a more sustainable, natural
        world. They are committed to driving change and minimising the impact on
        the environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        At No. 67 hairdressers we also believe that being part of your community
        that you and your clients live is important too. Sponsoring local events
        and being part in local voluntary groups is another way we show we care
        and are truly grateful for the support we’ve been shown. Where possible
        we support our local Refill project shop, taking our cleaning spray
        bottles and washing detergent bottles to be refilled and used again.
        It’s another way to support a fellow local business that has the same
        goals as us.

        loyal customers appreciate our efforts.
